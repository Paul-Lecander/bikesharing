# Citi Bike Analysis

## Overview of the Statistical Analysis

Citi Bike is a bike share company that rents out bikes for customers that want an easy and affordable way to get around New York City.

The aim of this analysis is to determine the feasibility of a similar bike share start up in Des Moines by using Tableau.


## Results

This analysis was created by making seven visualizations to get a better understanding of how Citi Bike works.
To get a sense of the scale for how many bike rides were used to gather this data, **2,344,224**, a visulization was created to reflect that: <br />

The next was to get a grasp of how long the trips lasted for the riders. As shown in the figure below, most rides lasted between 1 and 24 minutes with most rides lasting 5 minutes: <br />

To further understand Citi Bike's demographics of their customers, a pie chart was made to display the gender: <br />

A line graph was then created to determine if there was any difference between genders and trip duration: <br />

Determining the busiest times for bike riders was an important factor in the analysis. For this visualization, a heatchart was created to show the busiest times and days throughout the week: <br />
**Figure 5** <br />

The next logical step was to take the analysis done in figure 5 and apply it to each gender like the analysis done in figure 4: <br />

Finally, a comparison was done to show how many Citi Bike riders were subsribers to the service compared to non-subscribers between genders: <br />

## Summary

- As stated previously, there were 2,344,224 rides for this analysis. Most rides lasted only 5 minutes with the majority of rides lasting between 1 and 25 minutes (figure 2). <br />
- There was a significant contrast between the number of riders with males making up about 65% of the share and women making up only 25% of the riders. Although the numbers of men and women were starkly different, the trip duration (figure 4) was almost identical. <br />
- The busiest times for Citi Bike throughout the week were 6am-9am and 5pm-7pm from Monday through Friday (figure 5). This could mean that most users are riding the bikes to and from work. There was not a noticible difference between the busiest times for each gender (figure 6). <br />
- An analysis on the amount of subscribers and non-subsribers was made (figure 7) and the result was the number of male subscribers heavily outweighs any other user.

- If another analysis were created, I would suggest two other visualizations to be created. The first would assess the number of riders who are not subscribers but are close, or over, the threshold of rides that are comprable to a subscription. <br />
The second visualization would assess the distance travelled for each ride. That visualization could be valuable in determining the viability of a ride share in Des Moines because the layout of the two cities are so different.
